## What are Moodle UI components?

UI components are used to represent distinct UI elements, such as tables, buttons, dialogs, and others.
The main purpose of this library is to provide documentation for designers and developers when doing frontend development of new features.

## How to document a Moodle UI component?

An example page for describing a Moodle UI component can be found in folder `/content/moodle/components/example.md`. Start by making a copy of this file, make sure you edit the top part of the file; change ```title: "Example"``` to your page name and change ```draft: false``` to ```draft: true```

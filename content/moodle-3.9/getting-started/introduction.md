## What are Moodle UI components?


UI components are used to represent distinct UI elements, such as tables, buttons, dialogs, and others.
The main purpose of this library is to provide documentation for designers and developers when doing frontend development of new features.

## About this library

The Moodle UI component library has been developed to help Moodle developers and designers to create better user interfaces. Using this library allows you to collaborate more efficiently, it is a tool for visual designers, front-end developers, ux developers and anybody creating core Moodle code or Moodle extensions.

Whenever a new Moodle feature is created or updated the building blocks for the UI of the feature should be documented in this library. By doing so the Library will grow and it will become easier to re-use or reference repeating patterns and help the UI become more consistent.

Working on this library should be fun. The hard work of building it has already been done and the tools have been created to allow you to easily add or edit components. It will allow you to test them on your custom Moodle theme, share them and test them while they are added.

## Bootstrap docs

A large part of this library contains information about [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) components which are shipped with every Moodle installation. Bootstrap contains a lot of useful components and utilities which can safely be used for frontend development. For example, instead of adding custom CSS to add some padding in a box you should really look at the [spacing](/moodle-3.9/utilities/spacing) utilities from Bootstrap instead.

## Build with Hugo

This page and all other pages in the Component library are build using [Hugo](http://hugo.io), a static site generator that can turn documentation written in Markdown into nice pages like the one you are looking at right now.

## Using npm scripts

The package.json includes numerous tasks. Run `npm run` to see all the npm scripts in your terminal. **Primary tasks include:**

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Task</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>npm run docs-build</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Rebuild all of the docs pages in admin/tool/componentlibrary/docs
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>npm run docs-watch</code>
      </td>
      <td>
       Build all docs pages and keep watching for changes in admin/tool/componentlibrary/content
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>npm run css-compile</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Compile all scss for these docs pages.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
